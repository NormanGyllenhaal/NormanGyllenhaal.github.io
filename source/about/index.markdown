Hi there,

My name is Tom Schoonjans.

Some quick facts about me:

* Born in Anderlecht (Belgium) on March 26, 1982
* Studied chemistry (MSc) at Ghent University
* Did a PhD on X-ray Fluorescence from October 2006 to Januart 2012 at the same university, followed by short post-doc there as well
* Post-doctoral researcher at the University of Sassari (Sardinia, Italy) from September 2012 to September 2014.
* Post-doctoral researcher at the Bundesanstalt für Materialforschung und -prüfung (Berlin, Germany) from October 2014 to October 2015
* Currently a data analysis scientist at the Diamond Light Source

I have a strong passion for coding, which I developed during my PhD research. My favorite weapons are C and Fortran, although I also have some skill in C++, Java, Perl and IDL. Most of my development occurs on a Mac, which comes with a collection of [virtual machines](http://virtualbox.org), allowing me to produce releases of my software for all major platforms.

My main projects are [xraylib](http://github.com/tschoonj/xraylib), [XMI-MSIM](http://github.com/tschoonj/xmimsim) and [XRMC](http://github.com/golosio/xrmc), all of which are directly connected to my scientific research: Monte Carlo simulations of interactions of X-ray photons with matter. If you happen to be involved in this field of research as well, there's a good chance you may find them interesting, so feel free to check them out.

Apart from these, I am also a minor contributor to two other projects [FGSL](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fgsl/), Fortran bindings to the [GNU scientific library](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/), and [GtkExtra](http://gtkextra.sourceforge.net), a useful set of widgets for creating GUI's for GTK+. I am also maintaining an installer of the [Gtk+ 64-bit runtime environment for Windows](https://github.com/tschoonj/GTK-for-Windows-Runtime-Environment-Installer).

In 2015 I started a project for scientific plotting in Gtkmm3 called [Gtkmm-PLplot](https://github.com/tschoonj/gtkmm-plplot). It needs some additional work but it's already quite useful in its current state.

It goes without saying that all these projects are open-source and freely available!

I created this blog with the goal of sharing some of the more interesting problems I come across during my coding streaks, wherever I can with solutions.

Hope you may find this blog interesting. Don't hesitate to drop a comment, that would be greatly appreciated.
